## 🛠 Tech Stack  

- **React Native (Expo)** – Cross-platform mobile development  
- **TailwindCSS** – Fast and responsive UI styling  
- **Firebase** – Authentication & real-time database for data storage  
- **Local Device Access** – Parsing SMS for transaction insights  

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitation  

The **transaction tracking feature** was originally designed to parse SMS messages from **Bank of Baroda (BOB)**.  
Since BOB has recently updated its SMS format, the feature is **not functioning at the moment**.  
However, the underlying implementation demonstrates **robust SMS parsing, data categorization, and financial analytics logic**, and can be adapted to other formats with minor updates.  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Update SMS parsing to support new bank message formats  
- Expand support for multiple banks  
- Add advanced visualization for financial analytics  
- Export options

## 📌 Note  

This project was originally built for **personal use**, but it demonstrates:  
- **Practical problem-solving** (automating transaction tracking)  
- **Cross-platform mobile development** with React Native  
- **Data-driven features** (habit analytics, transaction summaries)  
- **Scalable architecture** (multi-user support with Firebase)  

It is a **work-in-progress showcase project**, highlighting both technical implementation and product design thinking.
